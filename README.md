# Sediment-Transport-in-Reservoir-under-Landslide-Induced-Surge-Wave

This numerical study will be an extension of my Spring 2021 CEE200B Final Project which used the provided MATLAB CFD code to study sediment transport and deposition in a reservoir entrance. The provided code will first be converted to Python for a better work environment and sediment transport at different locations in a reservoir will be looked at under a landslide-induced surge wave. An upgrade to a 3D model will be of the order.
